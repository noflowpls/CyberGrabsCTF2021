# Solution_Explain
When we go to website, It was same website with the first challenge. Cool, Right?
So, i go to login page and trying sql payloads.

# Sql Payload Worked! (but not get flag)
Payload = admin' or '1'='1

# Notice Parameter (?id=123)
So I have been crazy because sql injection not worked. 
But i noticed the (id) parameter and (values).

# Final Soultion (IDOR)
So I used Burpsuite to bruteforce the (Values) in the (?id=) parameter.  And Burp show me the values (1766).
So I paste the that value(1766) in the (?id=) parameter.  Yessssssssssssssss!
  We got flag.
